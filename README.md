#### Day 1 - Basic Syntax, Variables, Operators, Input/Output, if-else, switch

- [X] Q1. Write a program to print your name, age, city.

- [X] Q2. By using scanner get two numbers from the user and do math calculations like add, subract, multiply, divide and print those values.

- [X] Q3. Get a input from user and check the given number is odd or even and print apporiate messages.

   > =80 --> "Grade B"

   > Ex: 1 --> Monday, 7 --> Sunday, invalid --> "Wrong input"  
\# *Day 1 is completed at 30 Jan 5:28 PM IST*

#### Day 2 - Loops(for, while, do-while), Patterns, Simple Calculations   
- [ ] Q6. print numbers 1 to 10 using for loop and print sum of these numbers   
- [ ] Q7. get input from a user and calculate --> print the factorial of that number.  
    > Ex: 5 --> 120  
- [ ] Q8. print a Left angle triangle by using \* **pattern**.  
    > \*  
    > \*\*  
    > \*\*\*  
    > \*\*\*\*  
    > \*\*\*\*\*  
- [ ] Q9. get a positive number input from a user and check it is a **prime number or not**
